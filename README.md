Financial institutions must assess borrower risk accurately to minimize defaults while maintaining loan growth.
This project addresses:
What characteristics distinguish defaulters from non-defaulters?
Which financial indicators signal high risk?
Can borrowers be segmented into meaningful risk categories?
How can lenders reduce potential losses?
🧩 Dataset Description
The dataset includes borrower-level attributes such as:
Age, employment duration, and income
Debt levels and debt-to-income ratio
Credit card and other liabilities
Education level
Residential stability
Loan default status
⚙️ Methodology
1. Data Preparation
Missing value treatment
Data validation and cleaning
Feature understanding
2. Exploratory Risk Analysis
Default vs non-default comparisons
Distribution analysis of key variables
Correlation assessment
3. Risk Segmentation
Debt-to-income–based risk grouping
Probability of Default (PD) estimation
Identification of high-risk borrower profiles
🔍 Key Findings
📈 High debt-to-income ratio is the strongest predictor of default
💳 Higher credit debt significantly increases risk
👨‍💼 Longer employment duration reduces default probability
👶 Younger borrowers exhibit slightly higher risk
💰 Income alone is a weak predictor without considering debt burden
💼 Business Impact
Financial institutions can use these insights to:
Improve loan approval criteria
Implement risk-based pricing strategies
Identify high-risk applicants early
Reduce default rates and financial losses
Strengthen portfolio stability
